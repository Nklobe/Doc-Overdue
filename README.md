# Doc-Overdue

A Bachelor Degree thesis project:
Doc-Overdue scans your server and compiles a report of what is installed, what configuration files have been modified and what those modifications are. 
The script is tested and built for Ubuntu 20.04 ATM

## Features

The best summary of the project is the research question:

"To which extent can changes made to system-wide configuration files in Linux systems since their initial installation identified and extracted for further processing by human system administrators or automated configuration management tools?"

TL:DR it finds all configuration files and checks if they have been changed.
Thsi will give an overview of the system.

## Motivation

To help administrators find changes made to a system as soon as possible

## Requirements

Requirements for the script to work:

+ Only works on Debian systems aka Debian/Ubuntu/Mint

+ [Python3](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

+ [Sphinx](https://facebook.github.io/react/)


## Installation or Getting Started

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project, e.g.,
